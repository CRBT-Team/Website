# CRBT - Privacy Policy

##### Last update: January 9th, 2022

When you make use of the CRBT service, by adding it to a server, removing it from a server or by using it as a Discord user, you automatically apply to this privacy policy.

## Your privacy controls

For now, you cannot opt out of the data collection, but I will be adding a way for users to easily download, review or completely erase the data we store in our servers.
Until then, you can always **[email me about it](mailto:clembs@clembs.xyz)**.

## How your data is used

The CRBT team does __not__ give, share or sell your data to anyone. 
Your user & server data is only accessible by me, the creator and main developer of CRBT, Clembs.
This data is used to understand how is CRBT used so I can improve on its fluency and its ease of use. I also use this data in order to understand what commands are more used than others in order to prioritize the development of them.
I will also use the user ID to track potential abusers and breach-exploiters. 

## What data is logged

##### When using a command (through Slash Commands):
- The full command name, along with its options
- Your public Discord user ID

##### When inviting or removing CRBT on a server:
- The server/guild name and ID

## Where this data is logged

Logged command & server data is sent in a private Discord channel only accessible by me, Clembs, and CRBT itself.
Note: We use [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) to host CRBT (but no data should be stored there aside from Discord.js caching), and [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for the database.
