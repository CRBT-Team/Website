# CRBT - January 2022 Update

CRBT is now verified!!! Thank you so much guys for making this achievement possible!

> âš  Warning: CRBT v11 is still in beta, so bugs can happen and the bot isn't completed yet.
> If you find any bugs, make sure to `/report` them.

## Added

- `/server icon`
- `/user banner`
- `/define`
- Telemetry, read the new privacy policy [here](/privacy)
- Bumped Discord.js & [Purplet](/purplet) versions

## Changed

- Changed some commands to be subcommands, so they have spaces in their names (e.g. `/userinfo` => `/user info`)
- Removed user presences due to losing this intent since the verification of CRBT.

## Fixed

- Several typos
- Commands stuck on "is thinking..." or not loading at all
