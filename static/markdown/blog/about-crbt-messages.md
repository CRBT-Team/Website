### What??

So you are on Discord, using CRBT (or maybe not!) and suddenly you receive this:

![Sudden DM from CRBT!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/639241740800491566/937984726550077460/unknown.png) (or similar)

That is what we call a CRBT message!

### Why?

You may receive CRBT messages on multiple occasions, including:

- [ðŸ”—](#about-bug-reports-or-suggestions) A bug you reported (with the `//report` command) got fixed or rejected.
- [ðŸ”—](#about-bug-reports-or-suggestions) Something you suggested (with the `//suggest` command) got added to CRBT, or was rejected.
- [ðŸ”—](#about-bug-reports-or-suggestions) You got a message from the CRBT developers to your suggestion or bug report.
- [ðŸ”—](#about-blocklisting-on-crbt) You got blocklisted or unblocklisted by a CRBT developer
- [ðŸ”—](#about-being-striked-from-a-discord-server) You got striked (banned, warned, kicked, muted) by a moderator
- [ðŸ”—](#other-occurences) Other occasions

### About bug reports or suggestions

You typically receive this type of message whenever an official CRBT developer has interacted to a suggestion or bug report you sent. These interactions can be:

- An approval
- A denial
- A reply

If your suggestion or bug report was denied, a message may have been provided by the developer themselves explaining why it was denied. You may send your issue again with the appropriate information.
If your suggestion or bug report was approved, hurray, and thanks for submitting that issue!

### About blocklisting on CRBT

You will receive this type of message whenever a CRBT developer has blocklisted or unblocklisted you from using CRBT.

If you've got blocklisted, this means you will not be able to use CRBT any longer and that nobody will be able to interact with you within the CRBT economy system. Most of the times a message is attached by the developer detailing the reasoning behind your blocklisting. If you want to dispute this blocklisting, feel free to join the [Discord server](https://crbt.ga/discord) and ask to get unblocklisted.
If you've got unblocklisted, well GG you can get back to using CRBT like you used to.

### About being striked from a Discord server

This message is sent to you whenever a moderator from a server you're in strikes you, i.e. when you receive a warning or a mute, or when you're kicked or banned from the said server (getting unbanned or unmuted also gives you a message).

Example: Getting warned from CRBT Community by Clembs#2925.

Please note that CRBT is never affiliated with the server, the moderator or the message you received. CRBT is only forwarding the strike to your messages, and is in no way responsible for the content of the message or the origin server, even if its a Partnered Server.

### Other occurences

You may receive other kinds of messages from CRBT, including:

- ~~Broadcasted partner messages (assuming you're a CRBT Partner)~~
- ~~Updates on CRBT's news (if you've signed up for them)~~ (coming soon)
- Broadcasted CRBT Dev messages (if you've got access to CRBT Dev)
