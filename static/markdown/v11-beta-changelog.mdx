## Added Slash Commands!!

They're replacing the old message commands, which are now completely removed.

Not all commands are ported over for the time being, but I made sure to add as much as I could:

- `/userinfo`
- `/pfp`
- `/emojiinfo`
- `/roleinfo`
- `/channelinfo`
- `/serverinfo`
- `/crbtinfo`
- `/ping`
- `/report`
- `/activity` (combining all of the Activity commands)
- `/set-color`
- `/lenny`, `/reverse`, `/shout`
- `/8ball`, `/calc`, `/convert`, `/pick`, `/rng`, `/translate`

Many commands are missing for now, but I'll make sure to bring more and more of them on the following weeks.

## Changed

- `/serverinfo` now supports Stickers, Stage channels and Boosting plans.
- `/channelinfo` supports Stage channels as well, and will now give more info depending on the channel type.
- `/userinfo` will now give you the ability to see all activities of a user, including their Spotify activity and Custom Status.
- `/emojiinfo` returns more info on an Unicode emoji, like its name, since when it is available, its category and more designs.
- `/set-color` adds the ability to sync your accent color with your Discord Profile color (with `/set-color color:profile`)
- Tweaked the designed of `/8ball`, `/translate` and `/pick`

## Temporarily removed

- Economy commands & CRBT Store
- CRBT Profiles
- Usage telemetry
- Animal commands
- Auto-publishing messages
- Logs
- Moderation commands
- NSFW commands
- Some fun commands
- Some administration commands
- A lot of info commands
- Some other stuff I forgot to mention

## Removed

- The ability to change CRBT's prefix
- The ability to disable certain modules
- The `//help` command, as typing `/` now offers a similar result with Discord's UI.
- All user data, as the original database was reset and destroyed. We are now using Supabase for the database, which should work way better.
