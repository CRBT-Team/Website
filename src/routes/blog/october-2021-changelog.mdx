## Added

#### Activities

I added more activities from Discord, make sure to try them out, they're a lot of fun!

- `//lettertile`: Letter Time
- `//watchtogether`: Watch Together (replaces YouTube Together)
- `//wordsnacks`: Word Snacks
- `//doodlecrew`: Doodle Crew

#### Member logs

I'm upgrading CRBT's logging features by adding join and leave logs, that are working similarly to other CRBT logs.

- Use `//memberlogs <channel>` to enable member logs and define where they should be sent.
- More logs will be added in the future!

#### API Improvements

- Added the /other/translate endpoint for translating text using Google Translate, with language detection, auto-correction and source/target language.
- Added new private GET and POST requests for the CRBT database, for use by future CRBT-related projects (web dashboard? ðŸ‘€).
- Updated the /other/anime endpoint to use request queries instead of values in the path (/other/anime/{id} -> /other/anime?title={id}).

#### Improved ()translate

Using the new API endpoint, I've added several quality-of-life improvements to the `//translate` command:

- Loads way faster
- Less fail rates
- Better language detection
- You can specify the source language using `//translate <target lang> <text> -from <source lang>`
- Compatible with more languages
- Suggests corrections to your text

## Changed

- Removed some packages and a lot of useless code (comments, bad formatting, lots of unused code, etc) for a smaller file size.
- Changed version naming rules to semver rules (YEAR.MAJOR.BUILD -> MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD)
- Updated old packages
- Added automatic developer mode for CRBT Dev
- Added a new "first-time notice" for activity commands
- Updated `//help fun` to include activities
- Added an halloween 2021 banner for the giveaway in the [CRBT server](https://crbt.ga/discord).
- Updated `//clear`'s log to be more consistent with other moderation logs.
- Auto-stats now show CRBT's version name and aoi.js version

## Fixed

- `//store` not working
- `//translate` not working
- `//ban`, `//mute`, `//kick` not working for unknown members
- Minor typos, wording tweaks, etc
- Auto-publish module not shown in the dashboard
