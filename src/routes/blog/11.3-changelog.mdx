## Economy

You heard (or read) that right, we brought the economy system back to CRBT!

The following commands are available right now:

- `/hourly` - Get a few Purplets
- `/balance` - Get your Purplet balance
- `/give` - Give Purplets to another user
- `/leaderboard` - Get the top 20 users with the most Purplets globally

We know that this is quite limited, and we will be adding more commands in the next updates. Stay tuned!

## Profiles

The well known CRBT profiles are also making a return to CRBT! To view yours or anyone else's, simply use **`/profile`** or right click the person and click "View CRBT Profile".

What about editing them though? Well that's where the magic happens!

<p class="subtext">Simply click on the "Edit Profile" button and fill out the info!</p>

We're also testing [CRBTscript v11](https://crbt.notion.site/CRBTscript-Docs-742706c71b5848c9a1b155d187573bba) in profile bios only this time! Make sure to give us feedback using `/suggest`.

## Context menu commands

Want to get fast access to someone's avatar? To someone's CRBT Profile? Translate a message or save it for later? Well, you can now do it with a single right-click!

Starting from now on, you can right-click on a message to:

- Bookmark it
- Translate it to your Discord locale
- Scan any QR codes

  <div class="column">

    <p class="subtext">Bookmarking messages is now child's play!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">

    <p class="subtext">Was ist das?? Just right click a message and translate it to your Discord locale.</p>
  </div>
</div>

You can also right-click a user to:

- Get their user info
- Get their avatar
- View their CRBT Profile

<p class="subtext">Easy peasy, right?</p>

## Reminders

You can now very easily set reminders using the `/remind me` command! You can set reminders up to 2 years in the future, and change whether it should be sent as a DM, or in a channel of your choice!

  <img src="https://cdn.clembs.xyz/q7AbFb0.png" alt="/remind me when:tomorrow at 3pm subject:buy flowers">
  <p class="subtext">Any kind of syntax should work, so you can for example write "tomorrow at 3pm", "in 30 minutes", "3M2w3d" or even "on July 2'!</p>

You can also view all of your reminders with the `/reminders` command.

And if you ABSOLUTELY need those sweet Purplets, and you just want to be reminded of when you can get your hourly payment? Worry not, you can now set a reminder right under the cooldown error message!

  <p class="subtext">FINALLY!</p>

## Voice Linkers

Got a #voice-text or a #no-mic channel for users that can't talk on your voice channel? You can now link access to the former whenever the user joins your voice channel with the `/voice-linker set` command!

  <p class="subtext">Just like magic!</p>
