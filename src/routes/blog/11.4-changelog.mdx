## More Privacy Controls!

Privacy online is everyone's right, and we respect that, so to review and manage your privacy prefrences using CRBT you can now use **`/privacy`**.
Learn more about our [privacy policy.](https://crbt.ga/policy)

## Polls Are Here!

Polls are great. We can use them to communicate with our guild members and see their opinions in specific subjects. So you now can do that by using **`/poll create`** and setting a title to be the subject, choose the channel to start the poll in, choose the poll ending date and finally setting more than one choice.

**Note:** You can end a poll before it's end date using **`/poll end`** with the wanted poll ID which is located at each poll's footer.

## Profile Upgrades!

CRBT profiles are great, don't you agree? That's why in this update we tried making them even greater.
We tweaked and changed the UI to be as efficient, thanks to the navbar that navigates between a user's profile, avatar and user info, as easy-to-use and as generally satisfying to look at.
We also added a website integration to the command, which basically enables you to see somebody's profile online on [crbt.ga](https://crbt.ga/)
You now can additionally add more optional information about you in your profile, like your birthdate and general location.
