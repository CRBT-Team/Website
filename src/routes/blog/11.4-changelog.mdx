## Polls

A new feature in CRBT v11 is the ability to create polls, which can be used to ask for your members' opinion on specific subjects. You can create a new poll using `/poll create` with a title and up to 10 choices. You can even choose to automatically end the poll after some time.

  <div class="column">

    <p class="subtext">Example output</p>
  </div>
</div>

You can also end a poll before its end date using `/poll end` with a poll ID located at each poll's footer.

## Profile Upgrades

As we introduced CRBT Profiles last month, many of you already created one for their account, so we kept on improving them in this version!
First, we redesigned the interface to be efficient, thanks to a new navigation bar to switch between a user's Profile, avatar and user info.

<p class="subtext">Quickly get a user's profile, user info and avatar</p>

And as you can see, you can now add more information about you in your Profile, like your birthdate, a website URL and your location.

Lastly, we introduced a way to get someone's profile by their profile name, which is much easier than using their ID, using a smart autocomplete in `/profile`.

## More controls for your privacy

Privacy is a fundamental right, so to review and manage telemetry prefrences, you can now use the `/privacy` command.
We've also updated our [privacy policy](https://crbt.ga/policy) to reflect these changes.

## Upgraded Issues & Suggestions

Another big change in this update is on the issues and suggestions system. First of all, they now use Discord's modal system which looks sick.

This also means you can add a description to your issue, which is a great way to explain what you're trying to achieve.

We also redesigned how issues look in the server, and made it easy for developers and issue reporters to discuss them.

<div class="grid">
  <div class="column">
    <img src="https://cdn.clembs.xyz/yEqer44.png" alt="An older issue">
    <p class="subtext">Here's how they used to look before. Quite messy and souless...</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
		<img src="https://cdn.clembs.xyz/WflXUK3.png" alt="A issue from the new system">
		<p class="subtext">Their new look!</p>
  </div>
</div>
		<img src="https://cdn.clembs.xyz/XhwOeZX.png" alt="A Reply button">
		<p class="subtext">A new reply button, allowing users to finally reply to CRBT issue update messages</p>

As for suggestions, they now use the same system as issues, but will also create a new thread message to allow other people to discuss about them.
