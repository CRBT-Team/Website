# CRBT - Privacy Policy

##### Last update: April 24th, 2022

When you make use of the CRBT service, by adding it to a server, removing it from a server or by using it as a Discord user, you automatically apply to this privacy policy.

## Your privacy controls

Since the 11.4 update, you can now safely opt out of any data collection on CRBT by using the `/privacy` command, and clicking on the "Disable Telemetry" button component on CRBT's reply.

Until then, you can always [email me about it](mailto:clembs@clembs.xyz).

## How your data is used

The CRBT team does **not** give, share or sell your data to anyone.
Your user & server data is only accessible by me, the creator and main developer of CRBT, Clembs.

This data is used to understand how is CRBT used so I can improve on its fluency and its ease of use. I also use this data in order to understand what commands are more used than others in order to prioritize the development of them.

I will also use the user ID to track potential abusers and breach-exploiters.

## What data is logged

##### When using a command (through any kind of Application Command):

- The full command name, along with its options
- Your public Discord user ID
- The channel type (guild/DM)

##### When inviting or removing CRBT from a server:

- The server name and ID

## Where this data is logged

Logged command & server data is sent in a private Discord channel only accessible by me, Clembs, and CRBT itself.

Note: We use [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) to host CRBT (but no data should be stored there aside from Discord.js caching), and [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for the database.
