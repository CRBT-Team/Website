# CRBT - Privacy Policy

##### Last update: July 14th, 2022

When you make use of the CRBT service, by adding it to a server, removing it from a server or by using it as a Discord user, you automatically apply to this privacy policy.

## Your privacy controls

You can safely opt out of any future data collection on CRBT by using the `/privacy` command, and toggling "Telemetry" off on CRBT's message.

## How your data is used

The CRBT team does **not** give, share or sell your data to anyone.
Your user & server data is only accessible by me, the creator and main developer of CRBT, Clembs.

This data is used to understand how is CRBT used so I can improve on its fluency and its ease of use. I also use this data in order to understand what commands are more used than others in order to prioritize the development of them.

Errors thrown by the CRBT bot are also logged in order to help me fix them. These will always throw a message to the user, noted as an "Unknown error message".

I will also use the user ID to track potential abusers and breach-exploiters.

## What data is logged

### When using a command (through any kind of Application Command):

- The full command name with its options
- Your public Discord user ID
- Whether the command was used in a server or through DMs

### When inviting or removing CRBT from a server:

- The server's name
- The server's ID

### When an unknown error occurs:

- The [interaction object](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object)

## Where this data is logged

Logged command & server data is sent in a private Discord channel only accessible by me, Clembs, and CRBT itself.

## Additional information

Although third-party services like [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com) are used by us to operate with CRBT, no Discord user data is stored on them.
