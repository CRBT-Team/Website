	<p>
		"The CRBT service" or "The service" defines the Discord bot as well as this web application we
		offer. By using it, you're bound to comply with these Terms.
	</p>
	<h2>Service usage requirements</h2>
	<p>
		You may use the CRBT service if you are at least the minimum required age to use Discord.

		</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are using CRBT as a business (who are you?), you confirm that you have the authority to
		act on behalf of that entity, and that entity accepts the Terms of Service.
	</p>
	<p>
		By using the CRBT service, you automatically agree to create an account tied to your Discord
		account. You are fully responsible for any activities that occur under your CRBT and therefore
		Discord account, regardless of circumstances. Though, if your access credentials or personal
		data has been stolen or violated, you should contact me via any given contact detail found on
		the website.
	</p>

	<h2>Account suspension</h2>
	<p>
		The owner, Clembs, reserves the right to suspend your account's access to the service, if in
		violation of these Terms.
	</p>
	<p>
		You will always be informed of such decisions, with a way to debate and dispute your suspension.
		If you have any on-going subscriptions or bought any software enhancements, you may not receive
		a refund in case of an account suspension.
	</p>

	<h2>Service content</h2>
	<p>
		Unless noted otherwise, all content available on the CRBT service is owned or provided by Clembs
		or its licensors.
	</p>
	<p>
		Therefore, you may not use such content in any way that goes against the service or copyright
		protection laws. As such, you may not copy, download, transform, sell, republish or edit the
		CRBT service to your, or any third party's own commerical intent. All of the aforementioned
		actions may be authorized for personal or non-commerical use.
	</p>

	<h2>User-provided content</h2>
	<p>
		You are allowed to upload, share or provide your own content to the CRBT service. By doing so,
		you confirm that you are legally allowed to do so, and that you are not infringing any
		third-party rights.
	</p>
	<p>
		The owner of the service may remove or delete any user-provided content with notice to the user,
		if such content represents any kind of risks to other users or third-parties, including but not
		limited to:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>NSFW content, such as gore or sexual content</li>
		<li>Copyright infringing content</li>
		<li>Content reported by public authorities</li>
	</ul>
