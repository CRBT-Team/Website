# CRBT - Privacy Policy
##### Last update: October 4th, 2021

When you make use of the CRBT service (bot), by adding it to a server, removing it from a server or by using it as a Discord user, you automatically apply to this privacy policy.

## Your privacy controls

As of August 2021, we removed the option to change the telemetry mode, as seeing a lack of interest in the toggle by users and for simplicity reasons.
In the incoming updates, we are planning to add a way for users to easily download, review or completely erase the data we store in our servers.
For the time being, you can always **[email Clembs about it](mailto:clembs@clembs.xyz)**.

## How your data is used

Here at CRBT, we do __not__ give, share or sell your data to anyone. 
Your user & server data is only accessible by the creator and main developer of CRBT, Clembs.
This data is used to understand how is CRBT used so we can improve on its fluency and its ease of use. We also use this data in order to understand what commands are more used than others in order to prioritize them.
If Complete mode is enabled, I will also use the user ID to track potential abusers and breach-exploiters. Note that this data is logged through messages sent into a private Discord server that only I and CRBT can access.

## What data is logged

##### Upon triggering a command:
- The command name along with the options (what come after the command name)
- Your public 16-digits Discord User ID
- The platform where the command was executed from (Desktop, Mobile or Web)

##### Upon inviting or removing CRBT on a server:
- The server name and its 16-digit ID

## Where this data is logged

Logged command & server data is sent in a private Discord channel only accessible by Clembs and CRBT.
Other data used for command suggestions and other analytics are stored in a database located in **[Kiwatech](https://kiwatech.net)**'s servers and are only used by CRBT to provide useful suggestions.
